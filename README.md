## Description
This package contain 2 different algorithms. 

* First algorithm is **Euclidean Algorithm**. Purpose of this algorithm is to find the greatest common divisor(GCD) of two numbers. For more information about this algorithm and pseudocode [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)

* Other algorithm is **Dijkstras Algorithm**. Purpose of this algorithm is to take a graph and an initial node and calculates the shortest path from the initial node to every other node in the graph. For more information about this algorithm and pseudocode [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

## Installation
Install the package using the following code in R.

```ruby
devtools::install_github("Hytreueroot/732A94_Lab3")
